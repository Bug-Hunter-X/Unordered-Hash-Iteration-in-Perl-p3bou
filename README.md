This repository demonstrates an uncommon Perl bug related to the unpredictable order of hash iteration.  The `bug.pl` script showcases the issue, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a solution using a sorted keys approach.  Perl's hash iteration order is not defined, so relying on a specific order can lead to unexpected behavior in your code. This example highlights the importance of understanding this aspect of Perl's hash implementation and how to handle scenarios where a predictable iteration order is necessary.
